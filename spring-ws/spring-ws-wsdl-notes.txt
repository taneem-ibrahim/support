Note: spring-ws WSDL can be exposed in 2 ways:

1. 	Simply add the WSDL to the root of the WAR, and the file is served normally. This has the disadvantage that 
    the "location" attribute in the WSDL is static, i.e. it does not necessarily reflect the host name of the server. You can transform locations by using a WsdlDefinitionHandlerAdapter.
    
2.   Every WsdlDefinition listed in the *-servlet.xml will be exposed under the bean name. So if you define a 
     WsdlDefinition bean name echo and location Uri as localhost:8080/echo  then WSDL would be server:port/context_root/locationURI_second_part/bean_name

i.e.http://localhost:8080/<context_path>/echo/echo.wsdl).

Also make sure you add the jboss context root in the *-ws.servlet.xml otherwise the WSDL will have the wrong endpoint soap:address.
